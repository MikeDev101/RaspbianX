# RaspbianX
This is a modified version of Raspbian Buster (Bare-minimal desktop version) for the Raspberry Pi using the Ubuntu MATE desktop environment with a fully custom theme and icon set. Made using a Raspberry Pi 4 2GB, so compatibility with older pis aren't guranteed.

The default username is "ubuntu", and the default password (including root) is also "ubuntu". This disk image will require a 32gb sd card, since it's backed up to a whopping 20ish GB in size. I've compressed it into a zip file for convenience.

# Changelog
* First build (03.21.2020) -  First initial version of RaspbianX. Not much going on here. Stable for use, but performance is eh. Minecraft 1.12.2 runs, but the audio engine lags a lot. Other than that, the OS is smooth and super-responsive. 

# Known bugs/issues, and what I plan on doing
* Minecraft Java Edition on the Pi: The sound engine is very laggy. Will be looking into soon.
* Lots of excess from the stock Raspbian Buster. I'm planning on rebuilding RaspbianX using Raspbian Buster Lite (just the OS), removing any old and unnecessary packages and programs.
* Checking for compatibility with older Pis. I don't know how well RaspbianX will perform on older Pis yet. 
(I currently have a Pi3 in use as my NAS and my LTE Gateway. I had a Pi Zero W, but I fried it's power regulator and the CPU by mistake. I do have another Pi3, but it refuses to boot at all. Not sure why.)

# RaspbianX
This is a modified version of Raspbian Buster (Bare-minimal desktop version) for the Raspberry Pi using the Ubuntu MATE desktop environment with a fully custom theme and icon set. Made using a Raspberry Pi 4 2GB, so compatibility with older pis aren't guranteed.

This uses the Adapta GTK3 theme, and the Tela circle dark icon set. Both of these are not by me.

The default username is "ubuntu", and the default password (including root) is also "ubuntu". This disk image will require a 32gb sd card, since it's backed up to a whopping 20ish GB in size. I've compressed it into a zip file for convenience.

Here is the login screen.

Take a look at the desktop here. (this won't look exactly like the image I provided above, but it's pretty much the same.)

Just a quick sample of how the menus would look like.

# Changelog
* First build (03.21.2020) -  First initial version of RaspbianX. Not much going on here. Stable for use, but performance is eh. Minecraft 1.12.2 runs, but the audio engine lags a lot. Other than that, the OS is smooth and super-responsive. 

# Known bugs/issues, and what I plan on doing
* Minecraft Java Edition on the Pi: The sound engine is very laggy. Will be looking into soon.
* Lots of excess from the stock Raspbian Buster. I'm planning on rebuilding RaspbianX using Raspbian Buster Lite (just the OS), removing any old and unnecessary packages and programs.
* Checking for compatibility with older Pis. I don't know how well RaspbianX will perform on older Pis yet. 
* Youtube pops and skips from time to time. Probably due to the bloat still present from the PIXEL desktop.
* Some menus don't comply with the system theme. Trying to figure it out myself.

# RaspbianX
This is a modified version of Raspbian Buster for the Raspberry Pi, using the Ubuntu MATE desktop environment, with a fully custom user interface.

The default username is "ubuntu", and the default password (including root) is also "ubuntu".

This disk image will require a 32gb sd card. Because of how github doesn't like large files, the disk image file can be found here: [todo: upload google drive link]

# Changelog
